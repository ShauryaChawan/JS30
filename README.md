   - **`transitionstart`**: Fired when the transition begins.
   - **`transitionend`**: Fired when the transition completes.
   - **`transitioncancel`**: Fired when the transition is canceled.

3. CSS Transition Properties:
These properties are applied to elements for smooth transitions between styles.

   - **`transition`**: A shorthand for specifying multiple transition properties.
   - **`transition-property`**: Defines which CSS property will transition.
   - **`transition-duration`**: Sets how long the transition will take.
   - **`transition-timing-function`**: Defines the speed curve of the transition (e.g., `ease`, `linear`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`).
   - **`transition-delay`**: Specifies when the transition will start after a delay.
   - **`transition-name`** *(deprecated)*: The name of a transition. Replaced by using `transition` shorthand.

4. CSS Transition Values:
   - **`ease`**: A transition that starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and slows down at the end.
   - **`linear`**: A constant speed throughout the transition.
   - **`ease-in`**: Starts slow and then speeds up.
   - **`ease-out`**: Starts fast and then slows down.
   - **`ease-in-out`**: Starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and slows down at the end.
   - **`cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n)`**: Custom timing function using cubic Bezier curves.

5. Other Transition-Related CSS Properties:

- **`will-change`**: Tells the browser which properties are likely to change, helping it optimize performance.
